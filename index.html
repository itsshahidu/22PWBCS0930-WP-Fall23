        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Shahid Ullah, and I proudly call Nowshera my hometown. I completed my Matriculation at Al-Asar Public
            School right here in Nowshera. Subsequently, I pursued my FSc in Pre-Engineering at Govt. College
            Peshawar.My academic journey has provided me with a solid foundation in the field of Pre-Engineering.Outside
            of my studies, I'm deeply passionate about art, particularly drawing and calligraphy, which I find
            incredibly fulfilling and enjoyable. My artistic skills have been a significant part of my life. Initially,
            I aspired to become an architectural engineer due to my love for drawing and sketching, but I've recently
            made the decision to pursue computer science as my future field of study. My future goal is to continue my
            studies in computer science to explore this exciting field further. I look forward to engaging with
            like-minded individuals in this field and learning together. If you'd like to discuss anything related to
            art, computer science, or anything else, please feel free to reach out.
